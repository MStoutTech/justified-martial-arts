# Justified Martial Arts
Static website for a martial arts dojo

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This website challenge was to use floats. 

Images from FontAwesome and Unsplash

## Optimizations

Planning to:
- [ ] Make site responsive
- [ ] Improve accessibility with alt text and WCAG standards
- [ ] Improving web sustainability with WSG and checking website carbon footprint 

## Lessons Learned:

Several of the backgrounds used images and I don't necessarily like how the images behave as a background in css for the container. I think I would probably play around with changing the positioning of the image actually being in the html and some sort of fixed or relative position that the image can have a z index to be behind text objects. This would also probably help images actually have accessible alt text descriptions.
